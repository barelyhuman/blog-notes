## About
While the repository is named for [https://grdn.site](https://grdn.site) it isn’t primarily written for it. 

This is a public repository of a github experiment with a tool that syncs with iCloud. 

The tool used here is called [Paper](https://papereditor.app), it’s a markdown editor written by an Indie Developer and pretty sweet to be fair. 

The other part of the experiment uses a simple Deno script that runs indefinitely on my terminal to monitor the iCloud folder for any changes from Paper and then sync to the targeted repository. 


Overall the whole thing is an experiment to see if I prefer this over quickly creating notes on my site.
